At the heart, I enjoy building things. What draws me to full-stack software development is taming the complexity inherent in inteconnecting components. Applications are defined by the quality and design of their backend services. Having a robust, scalable core that handles all the essential business logic and exposes it via a REST API yields tremendous benefits. Developing frontend applications that consume these services makes them lightweight and allow them to focus on good user experiences and interfaces. Creating reporting pipelines and integrating with CRMs, ERPs, and data analysis tools becomes easier as they can be consumers of the same API, or adhere to publish/subscribe paradigms.

I have worked on serveral enterprise level systems in my career in many different languages, including Python, C#, C, and Javascript.For most of these projects I've been a full stack engineer, working on both backend and frontend components. One of the core skills of a programmer is knowing how to use tools and leverage frameworks. I've worked with .Net (C#), .Net Core (C#), Django (Python), Flask (Python), and a seemingly endless list of javascript frameworks: react.js, angular.js, backbone.js, node.js, jquery.js, the list goes on. As such, working with Xamarin, a new and very exciting app development framework that is easily compatible with both Android and iOS and will have excellent updating/migration support, is a very welcome opportunity. 

What I am offering is engineering talent. The ability to make smart architecture design decisions, to build robust, available and performant services, and provide transparent and readable documentation. Those are qualities good software engineers exihibit and the ones I can demonstrate to possess. Below is a list of projects I have worked on.
